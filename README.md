<h2><b>What was wrong with the calculation?</b></h2>
<br>

* <b>relative angles and perspective:</b> these effects cannot account for an order of magnitude.

* <b>viscosity in capillary waves:</b> below 5kHz it can be neglected<sub><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165212510000806">[1]</a></sub>

* <b>Faraday Waves:</b> using the capillary waves dispersion relation and solving the inverse problem (i.e. forcing the toad's size to be 6cm) yields a frequency of 340 Hz. Here the fundamental frequency was set to between 1.4kHz and 1.5kHz. Faraday sub-modal waves could account for this phenomena, the final picture being the toad and the air vibrating at ~1.4Khz and the water responding to the toad's vibration at 350Hz. As an argument against it, no explicit mention to <i>CIRCULAR</i> Faraday Waves has been encountered in the bibliography research<sub><a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.100.053106">[2]</a></sub><sub><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/subharmonic-capillarygravity-waves-in-large-containers-subject-to-horizontal-vibrations/83FD4B29CEFC16C82139623944F5FCE6">[3]</a></sub>
